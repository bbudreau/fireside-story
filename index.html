        <p>It was a dark and stormy night.</p>
        <p>on the wrong side of town, trouble brews</p>
        <p>One man stood amongst the crowd with only a beer for defense.</p>
        <p>He drunkenly charges the crowd and just starts swinging</p>
        <p>As his head smashed the wall, he realized the crowd was a wall painting, and that he was very drunk.</p>
